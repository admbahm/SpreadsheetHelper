## Introduction

Lean Software Development emphasizes efficiency, waste reduction, and continuous improvement in software development processes. This repository provides tools to create key Lean templates using Pandas, a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. These templates can help you visualize workflows, perform root cause analyses, track improvements, and more.

## Features

- **Automated Template Creation**: Generate Lean Software Development templates with ease using Pandas scripts.
- **Customizable and Scalable**: Adjust the templates to fit your specific needs and scale them as your projects grow.
- **Efficiency and Accuracy**: Reduce manual work and potential errors by automating repetitive tasks.

## Templates Included

1. **Kanban Board Template**: Visualize your workflow with columns for different stages and color-coded task cards.
2. **Value Stream Mapping Template**: Analyze and design the flow of materials and information with pre-defined shapes and swimlanes.
3. **5S Audit Checklist**: Ensure a clean and organized workplace with a detailed audit checklist.
4. **Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys) Template**: Identify root causes of problems with a structured 5 Whys analysis.
5. **Continuous Improvement Log (Kaizen)**: Track small, incremental improvements over time with a Kaizen log.
6. **Burndown Chart Template**: Monitor the progress of your sprints with automated burndown charts.
7. **Process Improvement Plan Template**: Plan and manage process improvement initiatives with a comprehensive template.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:admbahm/SpreadsheetHelper.git
cd lean-software-development-templates
```

Ensure you have Python and Pandas installed. You can install Pandas using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Usage

Each template has a corresponding Python script in the `scripts` directory. To generate a template, run the appropriate script. For example, to create a Kanban Board template:

```bash
python scripts/create_kanban_board.py
```

Each script will generate an Excel file in the `output` directory. Customize the generated files as needed.
